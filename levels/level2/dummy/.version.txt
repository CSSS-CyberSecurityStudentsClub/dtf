I walk through the alley like I’m paging through the back of someone’s memory,
where the junk leans heavy — not trash, but time,
rusted bicycles frozen mid-escape,
TVs with their guts spilling out like they died telling secrets,
mirrors cracked not from anger,
but from forgetting who looked in last.

This place ain’t dead —
it’s humming under your feet.
A toaster curls in on itself like it remembers warmth,
a doll with no head still holding a daisy like
someone's love didn't finish.

And yeah, the world moved on —
shiny, clean, sterilized,
but here, under the grime,
under the sighs of metal and dust,
I hear it whisper:
"I was something once."
I still am.

Shopping carts sleep like old dogs.
Washing machines pray in silence.
A mattress with a cigarette burn shaped like hope
lies under a busted sky,
and I lie with it.

Not to fix it.
Not to save it.
Just to listen.

Because junk breathes.
It remembers.
And sometimes, when no one’s watching,
it dreams.
