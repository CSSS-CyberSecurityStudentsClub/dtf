I walked through the forest where the trees whispered secrets and the wind carried tales of old, where the soil smelled of forgotten dreams and the sky, painted in dusky hues, hummed like a lullaby, and I thought, perhaps if I jusk a little harder, bend my mind into the curve of the universe, I could find the key to the silent gate beyond the stars, for to jusk is to reach without reaching, to know without knowing, to hum with the rhythm of unseen tides, to feel the warm ache of possibility in your bones, and so I jusked through the morning fog, past the cracked statues and the gardens overgrown with time, past the man with a thousand watches who didn’t believe in clocks, past the cat that wore spectacles and told riddles only at dusk, past the river that flowed uphill and carried lanterns instead of leaves, and as I jusked further, I met a woman who wove thunder into scarves, and she told me, “To jusk well, you must first forget what isn’t broken,” and I nodded, because her eyes were full of constellations I couldn’t name, and behind her, a child was building a tower out of forgotten birthdays, one candle per floor, and each flame whispered someone’s secret wish, so I jusked into the candlelight, and it burned cold, like starlight on a winter tongue, and I kept walking, kept dreaming, kept twisting myself into the rhythm of that silent song, where to jusk meant to believe in the crack between seconds, to dance in the breath before lightning, to curl your thoughts around a silence so deep it echoes, and the ground beneath me pulsed with memory, old footsteps layered like palimpsests, and every jusk I took rewrote a page, erased a boundary, built a bridge between what was and what might be, and the trees began to lean in, listening, or maybe just remembering how to breathe, and I jusked until the mountains blinked and the moon cracked open like an egg, spilling poems down my shoulders, and I caught each one in cupped hands, reading them aloud to the fox that wore a crown of broken mirrors, and he said nothing, just nodded slowly and offered me tea brewed from the shadows of regrets, which tasted sweet, somehow, and in the distance I saw a staircase made of echoes, leading upward into a sky I couldn’t name, and each step whispered a name I had forgotten, or perhaps never known, and I jusked upward, with feet light and heart heavy, until gravity unbuckled its belt and let me float, and the stars rearranged themselves into maps only dreamers could read, and I followed them, weaving through clouds shaped like questions no one dared ask, and I jusked through the answers anyway, carving understanding out of confusion, holding paradox like a flower, and when I reached the summit of the sky, I found an old man playing chess with a raven, and they both looked up and said, “You’ve jusked well,” and I bowed, though I didn’t know why, and I sat, and listened, and finally, in the silence that followed, I understood that to jusk is not to arrive, but to keep going, to wander with purpose, to seek without fear, to build a home in the maybe, and I closed my eyes and breathed the stars, and whispered to the wind: I will jusk forever.
