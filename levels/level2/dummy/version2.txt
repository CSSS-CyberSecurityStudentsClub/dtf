I walked through the alley where broken bicycles leaned like tired old men and the rust sang softly in the wind, where puddles wore rainbows of spilled oil and the air smelled like yesterday’s sighs, and I kicked through the junk, the bent forks and torn shoes, the cracked mirrors that no longer showed anyone’s face, and I thought how junk is just memory in disguise, fragments of lives worn thin, lost buttons from stories no one finished, and I picked up a toy car with one wheel missing and wondered who cried when it broke, or if it was just tossed like everything else in this metal graveyard of might-have-beens, where even the shadows looked tired, slouched between dumpsters and graffiti-tagged hope, and I saw a TV with no screen, wires like intestines spilling out, and next to it, a headless doll clutching a plastic daisy, and I kept walking, hearing the crunch of forgotten things beneath my boots, hearing whispers in the wind like junk speaking in code, as if it still remembered purpose, remembered being wanted, and I found a record player with a cracked vinyl spinning silence, and I wondered what it used to sing before the needle broke and the world moved on, and further on was a mountain of chairs, none of them matching, thrones for ghosts or thrones for kings who never showed up, and I climbed them, each leg wobbly with memory, and looked out over the junkyard like a scavenger god, and the sun dipped low behind rusted ovens and shattered aquariums and I saw fish tanks that never saw fish, microwaves that never hummed, fridges still holding expired dreams, and I thought, maybe this is what heaven looks like for objects, a resting place of everything we cast off when we decided we were too clean, too busy, too modern for mess, and I found an old radio still trying to breathe static, like it wanted to remember voices, and I sat beside it, watching ants crawl through a toaster, and I whispered, "You mattered once," and the wind replied with the clang of a shopping cart tipping over, spilling its orphaned cargo — a boot, a stuffed bear, an unopened letter — and I kept moving through the junk, letting it speak, letting it guide me, finding beauty in the ugly, finding art in the discarded, seeing how every broken thing still holds a shape, a soul, a soft echo of use, and I passed a wall made of washing machines stacked like tombstones, all silent, all solemn, and a dog barked somewhere deep in the metal maze, and I chased it not to catch it but just to feel the motion, because junk slows you down, makes you listen, makes you see, and I crawled through a tunnel of crutches and televisions, through wires and wires and more wires, and emerged in a clearing where bikes hung like wind chimes from tree limbs, creaking in the breeze like old sailors telling stories, and I sat beneath them and laughed, because junk doesn’t lie — it’s raw, it’s honest, it’s what’s left when we’re done pretending, and I lay down on a mattress with a cigarette burn shaped like a star, looking up at the sky through holes in a corrugated roof, and I dreamed not of riches but of repair, of mending, of second chances, and I thought how junkyards are just museums no one curates, full of stories we’ve chosen to forget, and I listened to the sound of metal breathing, tired but alive, and I whispered thank you to the shattered glass, to the rusted bolts, to the lonely coat hanger twisted like a question mark, because junk isn’t junk — not really — it’s history waiting for hands brave enough to hold it again.
